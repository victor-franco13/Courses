Introduction to AI
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computers simulating human Intelligence processes
    like kearning, reasoning, self-correction, and creativity.

Historical Development
    AI exploration began in the 1940s and 1950s, inspired by the human brain's workings.
    Notable contributions include:
        -The turing test, by Alan Turing, used to determine a machine's capability to exhibit
        intelligent behavior
        -ELIZA, the first AI chatbot created in the 1960s

Acceleration in AI Advancements
    the onset of the internet and vast data availability propelled Machine Learning (ML), a
    subset of AI, allowing machines to learn and improve from vast data sets.
    In the 2010s, Deep Learning, inspired by human brain's neural networks, emerged, aiding
    in object and voice recognition

AI in Everyday Life
    AI's role has trasitioned from mere fascination to being an integral part of daily lives,
    aiding in image enhancement, spam filtering, traffic managemenet, healthcare diagnostics,
    and agriculural optimization, among others

ELIZA
    ELIZA, a computer program created in the 1960s, was one of the first programs disgned to
    have a conversation with people

    ELIZA would respond to what you said by using patterns and rules, making it seem like she
    understood you. One famous version of ELIZA acted like a therapist, where she'd often just
    repeat what you said back to you, which made some people feel like they were talking to a
    real person.
